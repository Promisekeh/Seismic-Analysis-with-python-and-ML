# Seismic Analysis with Python and ML
Machine Learning workflows for seismic interpretation and subsurface analysis


🛠️ *This repository is under active development.*

This project aims to build a robust and modular set of tools for seismic interpretation using Python and machine learning. The long-term goal is to develop workflows that combine geophysical principles with automation — supporting facies classification, lithology prediction, attribute extraction, and more.

## Current Progress

### ✅ `seismic_facies.ipynb`
- Loads a sample seismic section
- Displays seismic cubes, lines and depth slices
- Performs basic preprocessing
- Visualizes facies overlay on seismic lines

This notebook serves as the prototype for modularizing the seismic analysis workflow.

## 🧭 Planned Features

The following components will be added iteratively:

- [ ] Extracts texture-based features
- [ ] Applies unsupervised learning (e.g., KMeans) for facies classification
- [ ] **Data loading utilities** (support for SEG-Y, NumPy arrays)
- [ ] **Attribute extraction**: RMS amplitude, semblance, texture metrics
- [ ] **Facies labeling and evaluation** using well logs (if available)
- [ ] **Supervised ML models**: Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks
- [ ] **Crossline and 3D volume support**
- [ ] **Modular scripts** for reusability and reproducibility
- [ ] **Interactive visualization** using Plotly or Streamlit
- [ ] **Deployment-ready app** for demo/field use
